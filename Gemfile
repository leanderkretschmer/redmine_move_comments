# Gemfile for Redmine Move Comments Plugin

# This Gemfile is intentionally minimal to avoid conflicts with Redmine 6
# Redmine 6 already includes most development and testing gems
# All plugin dependencies are managed by Redmine's main Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

# No additional gems needed - Redmine 6 provides:
# - rspec (for testing)
# - rubocop (for linting)
# - pry (for debugging)
# - factory_bot_rails (for test factories)
# - All Rails and Ruby dependencies

# If you need plugin-specific gems, add them here with careful version checking

# Note: Redmine core dependencies are managed by the main Redmine application
# This Gemfile only includes plugin-specific development and testing gems
